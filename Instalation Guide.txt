Set up the website:

1. Open up your terminal on your Debian machine type: Wget
https://download.checkmk.com/checkmk/2.3.0p20/check-mk-raw-2.3.0p2
0_0.noble_amd64.deb, which pulls the Checkmk package
(go in website to verify that it is teh most recent one:
https://checkmk.com/download?method=cmk&edition=cre&version=2.3.0p21&platform=debian&os=bookworm&type=cmk&google_analytics_user_id=)

2. Then you type sudo apt install
./check-mk-raw-2.3.0p20_0.noble_amd64.deb, which instals all the
packages and dependencies.

3. To verify a successful installation type omd version, which should show
something like this under OMD - Open Monitoring Distribution Version
2.3.0p20.cre

4. To then create the monitoring site type sudo omd create siteName (replace
siteName with any name you want for the site) something like this should
show under:

Output

Creating temporary filesystem /omd/sites/monitoring/tmp...OK
Restarting Apache...OK
Created new site monitoring with version 2.3.0p20.cre.
The site can be started with omd start monitoring.
The default web UI is available at http://your_server/monitoring/
The admin user for the web applications is cmkadmin with password:
generated-password
(It can be changed with 'htpasswd -m ~/etc/htpasswd cmkadmin' as site
user.)
Please do a su - monitoring for administration of this site.
(Pay attention to the highlighted line since that is the username and password for the site)

5. To start the site type: sudo omd start siteName

6. You can visit the site by typing the IP address of the machine and the site
name in the browser, ex. (127.0.0.1/siteName) and enter username and
password


Adding Hosts:

machine, and on the left navigation click on Setup, then under Agents click

8. Open up the terminal and navigate to the download directory and type sudo
apt install ./check-mk-agent_2.3.0p20-1_all.deb to download the agent

9. Then navigate back to the browser and on the left navigation click on Setup,
then under Hosts click on Host. Then near the top right click on Add Host,
then enter the desired host name, tick the box next to the IPv4 address, and
enter the host's IP address. After entering all that information, Click on save &
run service discovery

10. All the services to monitor will pop up so click on x or + to remove or add it to
the monitored services

11. After deciding on all the desired services, on the top right click on Changes,
then press Activate on selected sites to apply the changes.
